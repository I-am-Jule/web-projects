Here I will upload different homepages I built.

## Recipe Website

The first one is a cooking website with recipes I built for a course at university. We had a given layout and had to code everything by ourselves.
The pictures have their references added as title and free to use.

## Recipe Website 2

I made a second recipe website, which has a more detailled look. It uses flexbox as a gallery mode and a small java script for a scroll button. As with the first recipe page, the pictures have their references added as title or on the bottom right corner and have a license with which you can use them for free.
